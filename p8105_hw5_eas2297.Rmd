```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing all of the file names.

```{r}
df = tibble(
  file_name = list.files("./data")
)
```

Next we iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using `purrr::map`. We will save the result as a new variable in the dataframe.
