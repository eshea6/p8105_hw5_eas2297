```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing all of the file names.

```{r}
df = tibble(
  file_name = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
)
```

Next we iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using `purrr::map`. We will save the result as a new variable in the dataframe. 

```{r}
read_file = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}
```

```{r}
df_untidy =  
  df %>% 
mutate(
  file_data = map(file_name, read_file)
) 
```
