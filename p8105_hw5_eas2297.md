## Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing all of the file names.

``` r
df = tibble(
  file_name = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
)
```

Next we iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
`purrr::map`. We will save the result as a new variable in the
dataframe.

``` r
read_file = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}
```

``` r
df_untidy =  
  df %>% 
mutate(
  file_data = map(file_name, read_file)
) 
```

    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Finally we need to tidy the resulting dataframe.

``` r
df_tidy =
  df_untidy %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  separate(file_name, c("arm", "subject"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(subject, c("subject_ID", "remove")) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, "./data/con" = "control", "./data/exp" = "experimental")) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = response, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(week, c("remove2", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-remove, -remove2) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  arrange(arm, subject_ID)
```

    ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 52179 rows
    ## [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
    ## 39, 40, ...].

With our tidy dataset we will make a spaghetti plot showing observations
on each subject over time.

``` r
df_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = response, color = subject_ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 417432 rows containing missing values (geom_path).

Based on this plot, we see that the experimental group saw increases in
response over time, while the control group generally stayed the same
over time with some fluctuations by week and possibly even a slight
downward trend.

## Problem 2

First we need to read in the data.

``` r
homicide_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

The raw data includes `ncol(homicide_data)` variables and
`nrow(homicide_data)` observations; each observation represents an
individual homicide case. Variables include a unique ID that
incorporates location information, date the homicide was reported,
victim information (last name, first name, race, age, sex), city, state,
latitude and longitude of the incident, and the disposition
(i.e. status) of the case. Unidentifiable characteristics are reported
as ‘Unknown’.

Next we will create a `city_state` variable.

``` r
US_hom_data = homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "))
```
