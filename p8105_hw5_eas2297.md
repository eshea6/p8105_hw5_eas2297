## Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing all of the file names.

``` r
df = tibble(
  file_name = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
)
```

Next we iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
`purrr::map`. We will save the result as a new variable in the
dataframe.

``` r
read_file = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}
```

``` r
df_untidy =  
  df %>% 
mutate(
  file_data = map(file_name, read_file)
) 
```

Finally we need to tidy the resulting dataframe.

``` r
df_tidy =
  df_untidy %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  separate(file_name, c("arm", "subject"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(subject, c("subject_ID", "remove")) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, "./data/con" = "control", "./data/exp" = "experimental")) %>% 
  gather(key = week, value = response, week_1:week_8) %>% 
  separate(week, c("remove2", "week"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-remove, -remove2) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  arrange(arm, subject_ID)
```

With our tidy dataset we will make a spaghetti plot showing observations
on each subject over time.

``` r
df_tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = response, color = subject_ID)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(~arm)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_eas2297_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="90%" />

Based on this plot, we see that the experimental group saw increases in
response over time, while the control group generally stayed the same
over time with some fluctuations by week.
