## Problem 1

First we create a dataframe containing all of the file names.

``` r
df = tibble(
  file_name = list.files("./data", full.names = TRUE)
)
```

Next we iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
`purrr::map`. We will save the result as a new variable in the
dataframe.

``` r
read_file = function(file_name) {
  read_csv(file_name)
}
```

``` r
df_untidy =  
  df %>% 
mutate(
  file_data = map(file_name, read_file)
) 
```
